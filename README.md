# tec-Vectrex
Vectrex display for TEC-1, well the start of one

## goals
* playing with dac and adc circuit 
* expand visual display, add 2 extra 7 seg leds, add integrated 8x8 led matrix, piggy back off exiting muxing
* add 2x dac conversion piggy back off display, 
  * use resistor array, stage 2 try a dac chip around $4
  * drive cro xy inputs for visualization, 
  * try oscilloscope music, 
  * stage 2 try forth code the create similar effects
* add 2x adc conversion feed into latch, use resistor array, stage 2 try a adc chip around $8
