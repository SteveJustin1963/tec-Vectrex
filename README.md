# tec-Vectrex
Vectrex display for TEC-1, well the start of one

## goals
* expand visual display, 
  * add 2 extra 7 seg leds, run off 2 free ports
  * add integrated 8x8 led matrix, piggy back off exiting led muxing
  * add stereo sound
* playing with dac and adc circuits 
  * add 2 x dac ccts, piggy back off led display lines
  * try simple resistor array, stage 2 try a dac chip around $4
  * drive cro xy inputs for visualization, 
    * try oscilloscope music, 
    * stage 2 try forth code to create similar effects
    * drive cct for analog devices 
      * eg; tv or crt xy yoke coils, 
      * drive stepper motors, 
      * coil drive for xy laser pointer
  *
* add 2 adc conversion feed into latch, use resistor array, stage 2 try a adc chip around $8
*
