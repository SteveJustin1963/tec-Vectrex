# tec-Vectrex
A Vectrex display for TEC-1

The Vectrex is a vector display-based home video game consoleâ€“the only one ever designed and released for the home market, developed by Smith Engineering 1982.
The Vectrex was praised for its software library, unique graphical capabilities, and built-in monitor. It was the first console to have a 3D-based peripheral. The computer controls the vector generator, which makes the screen drawings. The computer controls the integration rates using a digital-to-analog converter, and the monitor uses voltage ramps to steer the electron beam. The Vectrex's cathode ray tube is a standard Samsung model 240RB40 manufactured for small black/white television sets. It uses a computer-controlled integrator and linear amplifier to direct the internal electron beam in a vector pattern. The light pen allows the user to create images and to indicate on the screen. It uses a photo-detector to track the pen's location and to change its pattern size as the pen moves.

### project
get the tec1 to drive two DAC into the xy of a cro or crt tube coil deflector. also modulate the beam on and off.
with code draw the vector graphics, use asm and MINT.

- drive cro xy inputs for visualization
- drive DAC 
- off 7 seg leds, run off 2 free ports
- off 8x8 led matrix, piggy back off exiting led muxing


### Iterate
- make oscilloscope music and drive the vectrex display, need two audio channels
